#	ANC
A little project on software driven active noise cancellation. Very newly started. The basic idea is to record
ambient noise, generate the corresponding anti-waveform and play it through the earphones. This project is intended 
to facilitate learning Python. 

## Stuff done
* Basic IO operations from txt file.
* Some list manipulation tools.

## To do
* Design dedicated data retrieval routine from soundcard for microphone (I am aware there are libraries for this)
* Look into FFT as a means to generate waveform (again, I am aware others have done this)
